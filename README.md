# Advent of Code 20205

My attempts at Advent of Code 2025.

I'm trying to implement this in Swift. I'm no expert, so there might by some very... _un_-swift-like code here...


To compile and run the code, use the following command:

`swift run -c release aoc day[x] input.txt --task [x]`

Just specify `day[x]` (e.g. `day1`, `day2`, etc.), the day's `input.txt` file, and which task (For part 1 or part 2) as `--task 1` or `--task 2`.
